### Why does `LinkedStack` not require an explicit constructor?



### What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the `LinkedStack` methods, as well as `ReverseLines.main`?



### How else (not using `Node`) could we have implemented `LinkedStack` in such a way that it is still based on a linked list but the `asList` method uses constant time and space?



### Is it better for `push` and `pop` to return the item or the stack itself?  Briefly discuss the pros and cons of each design.
